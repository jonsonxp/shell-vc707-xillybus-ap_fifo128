2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-3#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on Clock Modifying Block  
A primary clock sys_clk is created on the output pin or net xillybus_interface_0/xillybus_ins/pcieclk_ibuf/O of a Clock Modifying Block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock userclk1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_userclk1 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_userclk1 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_userclk1 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_userclk1 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 21 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks userclk1 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 28). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 21 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks userclk1 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 31). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#3 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 22 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 and userclk1 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 29). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#4 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 22 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 and userclk1 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 30). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 21 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 22 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock userclk1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 21 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins xillybus_interface_0/xillybus_ins/pipe_clock/pipe_clock/mmcm_i/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#4 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock userclk1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 22 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins xillybus_interface_0/xillybus_ins/pipe_clock/pipe_clock/mmcm_i/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>
